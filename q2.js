// In JavaScript, the comma operator is used to combine multiple expressions into a single expression. It evaluates each of its operands (from left to right) and returns the value of the last operand. The expressions are separated by commas.
let a=5,b=7,c=3;
let result=(a++,b++,c++);
console.log(a);
console.log(b);
console.log(c);
